I don't write very many proposals, but the ones I do write, I try to make them winners.  This requires getting started early (months ahead) and not leaving things for the last minute.  There are many times I've decided not to submit a proposal rather than try to rush it.  Annual deadlines make this an expensive choice, and I was very unhappy when my directorate at NSF moved from 2 submission opportunities/year to just 1.  Fortunately I have tenure, it's always possible to get 1-2 students who are funded via TAs or outside employment, and my job security doesn't depend on bringing in grant funding, so proposal-writing is not a major stressor in my life.",Yes,3-4,B,50-75%,"2-4 weeks","6-12 months","Significantly more",50,40,0%,10,100,70,30,0,0,100,"1-3 hours before deadline","Significantly  more","Little disruption","Extreme disruption","No disruption","No disruption","No disruption","I learned early on that rushing to complete a research project in time to make a paper deadline can lead to poor outcomes, so I never make that mistake any more.  What I mostly struggle with now is getting the writing done on time, particularly when re-writing students' work.  It takes >3x longer to fix what a student has written than it would to write it myself and I keep forgetting that, leading to a situation where I end up editing until 3-4am before a 6am paper deadline and that's unhealthy, as well as being hard on the student.        With respect to any deadline, I think the important thing is for submitters to learn to plan ahead.  This means accurately estimating the time that will be needed to complete the task well and scheduling that time in during the weeks and months prior to the deadline.    The top conferences in my field have moved to a journal-conference hybrid model where submitters can either aim for the conference deadline or submit directly to the journal and then after the paper is accepted they can request to present it at the next annual conference.  This option is only for the best work (journal quality) but I think it works very well.

It is a lot of extra work for panelists and for me, but if I do not hit the proposal deadlines, I am viewed as deadweight by my academic unit. So I (and many around me) submit because that is what we are told we should do to maintain the prestige of the university.    I am an interdisciplinary researcher, and the projects I work on that are funded by divisions of NSF without proposals mature to a point where I am ready to ask for funding. At that point, I submit without being hassled by the research advancement staff. I might submit less proposals because of the less pressure, but I get more good work done.    On the other hand, if I'm awarded one of the worse proposals that I submit just because there is a deadline and I am expected to submit, then it is unlikely I will use the awarded funds for exactly what I proposed. So it is basically just institutionalized gambling - a bad proposal goes in, may get lucky enough to get funded, and then the funding agency is going to be lucky if the work that is completed has anything to do with the original proposal.    As a side note, the NSF CAREER needs to be abolished. It is a poor model for all other kinds of proposals someone will submit later in their career. Single-investigator grants (and papers) are so archaic. The CAREER process is not much worse than a normal grant, and so why not just devote the effort to a normal proposal (perhaps without the arbitrary deadline)? Furthermore, no other proposal requires silly things like letters of support from the department. These departmental letters are form letters that basically just advertise the standard concessions that a department gives its tenure-track faculty (which do not vary much across universities anyway). Why force a faculty member to jump through these extra hoops? If you really care about fostering leadership, then find a way for young investigators to lead multi-investigator grants and get help from more senior investigators who sign on as Co-I. The opportunity cost (in terms of time and money) of the CAREER program is far too high to justify it continue its existence. NSF got rid of the DDIG, which it should have kept, and kept the CAREER, which it should have gotten rid of.",Yes,5-6,A,20-30%,"2-4 weeks","3-6 months","Significantly more",70,20,10,0%,100,80,20,0,0,100,"1-3 hours before deadline","Significantly  more","Extreme disruption","Extreme disruption","Extreme disruption","Extreme disruption","Extreme disruption","As an interdisciplinary researcher, I submit manuscripts to journals (with no deadlines) as well as conference proceedings (with deadlines). My conversations with computer scientist collaborators usually pick a deadline in the next month and then decide to come up with something (no matter the merit) to submit to that deadline. My conversations with my other collaborators are about research, and once the research results are strong enough, then are they about publication venues. The latter way to do research produces more significant results that I'm much more proud of. The former/CS way to do research produces more short papers that I'm sometimes embarrassed are released onto the world.    In addition, my students learn much more from the revise and resubmit process. Conference rebuttal periods are not a good substitute for revisions. Furthermore, when manuscripts are submitted to different conferences later, the manuscripts don't change much (whereas in a revise and resubmit to a journal, they do change in order to address the comments of the reviewers).     Finally, because conferences in CS are primarily for being venues for terminal archival research reports, they lose the ability to do what a conference is ostensibly supposed to do - have productive conversations that move research frontiers forward. In the disciplines I participate in where publications only come out in journals, conferences have much smaller registration fees (often nearly free for students) and have first-come, first-served registration for talk and poster slots. Students get an equal opportunity at these slots as faculty to get feedback on their work (sometimes I see faculty presenting posters right next to students presenting posters). Students can talk about empirical results that they have not made sense of completely yet and get good insights from the rest of the research community without the worry of someone scooping them.    I think computer scientists feel that it is OK that they have cannibalized their conferences to use instead as publication venues because arXiv takes the place of advertising results early and getting feedback, but arXiv is not a conference venue.    Deadline-driven conference publications are broken and need to be abolished. They are antithetical to the mission of the academy.",2,"Not at all 1",5,2,6,6,Sometimes,Often,"Almost never","Almost always",Often,Sometimes,Sometimes,Often,Sometimes,Sometimes,Often,Often,"Almost never",Sometimes,Often,Sometimes,Sometimes,Often,Sometimes,"Almost always","Agree a little","Neither agree nor disagree","Agree a little","Neither agree nor disagree","Neither agree nor disagree","Disagree a little","Agree a little","Neither agree nor disagree","Agree a little","Agree strongly","Not much like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Not at all like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me",Neutral,"Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me",Neutral,Neutral,"Not at all like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Somewhat like me","Not at all like me",tpavlic@asu.edu,tpavlic@asu.edu,Complete

I go through email about twice per day to do medium size tasks, but the big tasks tend to get left for several days so I can schedule time to take care of it.  I generally think proposal deadlines are good because it give you a point in time to aim for.
