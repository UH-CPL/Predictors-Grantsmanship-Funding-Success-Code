Annual deadlines make this an expensive choice, and I was very unhappy when my directorate at NSF moved from 2 submission opportunities/year to just 1.

It is a lot of extra work for panelists and for me, but if I do not hit the proposal deadlines, I am viewed as deadweight by my academic unit. So I (and many around me) submit because that is what we are told we should do to maintain the prestige of the university.    I am an interdisciplinary researcher, and the projects I work on that are funded by divisions of NSF without proposals mature to a point where I am ready to ask for funding. At that point, I submit without being hassled by the research advancement staff. I might submit less proposals because of the less pressure, but I get more good work done.    On the other hand, if I'm awarded one of the worse proposals that I submit just because there is a deadline and I am expected to submit, then it is unlikely I will use the awarded funds for exactly what I proposed. So it is basically just institutionalized gambling - a bad proposal goes in, may get lucky enough to get funded, and then the funding agency is going to be lucky if the work that is completed has anything to do with the original proposal.    As a side note, the NSF CAREER needs to be abolished. It is a poor model for all other kinds of proposals someone will submit later in their career. Single-investigator grants (and papers) are so archaic. The CAREER process is not much worse than a normal grant, and so why not just devote the effort to a normal proposal (perhaps without the arbitrary deadline)? Furthermore, no other proposal requires silly things like letters of support from the department. These departmental letters are form letters that basically just advertise the standard concessions that a department gives its tenure-track faculty (which do not vary much across universities anyway). Why force a faculty member to jump through these extra hoops? If you really care about fostering leadership, then find a way for young investigators to lead multi-investigator grants and get help from more senior investigators who sign on as Co-I. The opportunity cost (in terms of time and money) of the CAREER program is far too high to justify it continue its existence. NSF got rid of the DDIG, which it should have kept, and kept the CAREER, which it should have gotten rid of."

We do not have a dedicated grants person in our department, and we have to rely on University-wide administrators. They are kind, and hard working, but they have yet to help me submit a proposal in 5 years where I have not found an error on their part of the process in terms of filling out the forms for grant proposals related to institution, forgetting University documents, or uploading for an incorrect PAR number. I would say this contributes to the most stress for me when submitting proposals, because in addition to proofreading and triple checking my own parts related to the science, I also have to spend time quality control checking all of their tasks to catch their errors before submission."

This requires us to compile many of our ideas and hone them into a good story. As it has currently stood, much of the ""prior research"" for proposals has been completed within the ~1month before the deadline. Some of this is due to waiting for calls to identify topics, forming teams, etc., but also due to prioritization. We are so focused on meeting our existing deadlines for FUNDED programs that we cannot devote the time to exploring the NEW ideas/concepts until we have no other choice. This leads to a constantly high stress level. Although you can get things done, you never have enough time to get ahead, to think creatively, and truly explore limits. It is simply chasing one deadline to the next.    I am not sure replacing deadlines is a good thing. They are stressful but they are very helpful to force you to submit your idea."

When an RFA is announced in the middle of a semester, my time for that semester might already be too committed to respond to an RFA - I need to know BEFORE the semester starts so that I MIGHT be able to postpone some other things like undergraduate research projects or grad student rotations or committee work to the next semester.  I cannot create more hours in the day just because NSF decides that they are going to offer a novel type of interdisciplinary $1 million dollar grant but I have only ten weeks to put together a multi-university team, get the subcontracts together, AND write the proposal."

The constant need to chase after the next grant to support myself or my students take significant time away from publishing additional articles on past grants, as well as strongly discouraging truly innovative research ideas. If an idea deviates substantially from the natural ""next step"" on a topic, I know it has exactly 0% chance of success. It also strongly discourages me from applying to other agencies, since I know I'm not part of the ""old boys"" club, which is alive and well. The increase in amount of administration and forms disproportionately advantages researchers from top tier universities (including mine), which provide substantial administrative support in submission and management of grants. If I was at a lower tier university, there is no chance that I could submit and manage as many grants as I do currently. This is a fantastically effective way to squash diversity, by raising the status bar for individuals who can submit grants. My last grant to support one student for three years was over 225 pages long - and funding rates hover around 15%. What a tremendous waste of intellectual resources to spend hours and hours compiling CVs, C&Ps, COAs, and all the other required forms. It also strongly benefits senior personnel who have administrative staff that can maintain these resources for them. Some forms are obviously necessary, but why not refer reviewers to ORCIDs and google scholar or web of science profiles? Also, each agency has their own forms, so they aren't transferable. I submit to NIJ, NSF, NASA, as well as philanthropic foundations. Rolling deadlines would be better, since proposals are more likely to be submitted when they're truly ready, instead of when they're due. "

I typically put any non-urgent items on hold for the week or two before submitting and then spend the following week getting caught up.  Also, in regards to email, I sometimes respond right away if the email is quick and will help someone else continue working.  I go through email about twice per day to do medium size tasks, but the big tasks tend to get left for several days so I can schedule time to take care of it.  I generally think proposal deadlines are good because it give you a point in time to aim for.  Without deadlines, it is easy to push them off and it generally takes more time to actually complete it.  This is similar to students submitting journals (takes longer with no deadlines) compared to conferences (which have deadlines)."
