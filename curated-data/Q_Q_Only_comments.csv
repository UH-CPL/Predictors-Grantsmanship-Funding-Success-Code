But most of them I submit at least a day before the deadline. I still experience significant stress leading up to submitting, even though it is a day or so ""early."" I think continuous submission (like standing review committee members get) would decrease the amount of stress associated with any particular time of year. Now that proposals are submitted and handled electronically, it seems like there might be less need to have a deadline three months in advance of review. However, people might submit fewer proposals if they did not have an external deadline to keep them accountable."

"P_31",1,0,0,0,0,"I have been a faculty member for over 20 years.  I don't write very many proposals, but the ones I do write, I try to make them winners.  This requires getting started early (months ahead) and not leaving things for the last minute.  There are many times I've decided not to submit a proposal rather than try to rush it.  Annual deadlines make this an expensive choice, and I was very unhappy when my directorate at NSF moved from 2 submission opportunities/year to just 1.  Fortunately I have tenure, it's always possible to get 1-2 students who are funded via TAs or outside employment, and my job security doesn't depend on bringing in grant funding, so proposal-writing is not a major stressor in my life."

"P_38",0,0,1,1,0,"Not only do proposal deadlines give me more stress, but they lead to a majority of terrible proposals that I would have likely waited to submit (or not submitted at all). It is a lot of extra work for panelists and for me, but if I do not hit the proposal deadlines, I am viewed as deadweight by my academic unit. So I (and many around me) submit because that is what we are told we should do to maintain the prestige of the university.    I am an interdisciplinary researcher, and the projects I work on that are funded by divisions of NSF without proposals mature to a point where I am ready to ask for funding. At that point, I submit without being hassled by the research advancement staff. I might submit less proposals because of the less pressure, but I get more good work done.    On the other hand, if I'm awarded one of the worse proposals that I submit just because there is a deadline and I am expected to submit, then it is unlikely I will use the awarded funds for exactly what I proposed. So it is basically just institutionalized gambling -Â a bad proposal goes in, may get lucky enough to get funded, and then the funding agency is going to be lucky if the work that is completed has anything to do with the original proposal.    As a side note, the NSF CAREER needs to be abolished. It is a poor model for all other kinds of proposals someone will submit later in their career. Single-investigator grants (and papers) are so archaic. The CAREER process is not much worse than a normal grant, and so why not just devote the effort to a normal proposal (perhaps without the arbitrary deadline)? Furthermore, no other proposal requires silly things like letters of support from the department. These departmental letters are form letters that basically just advertise the standard concessions that a department gives its tenure-track faculty (which do not vary much across universities anyway). Why force a faculty member to jump through these extra hoops? If you really care about fostering leadership, then find a way for young investigators to lead multi-investigator grants and get help from more senior investigators who sign on as Co-I. The opportunity cost (in terms of time and money) of the CAREER program is far too high to justify it continue its existence. NSF got rid of the DDIG, which it should have kept, and kept the CAREER, which it should have gotten rid of."
"P_44",1,0,1,0,0,"Deadlines are easier for me to handle when I am the only PI. It stresses me far less, because I can work on my own pace. The moment I have Co-PI's it gets more chaotic, because I depend on the input from others, which I can't so easily control.    I submit proposals to two different NSF programs. One has deadlines, the other has no deadlines. At the program with deadlines I never got a proposal funded the first time. The other program (without deadline) funded my proposal after the first submission. This is not statistically solid, but I felt I submitted a much better prepared proposal when I had no deadline, because I waited until I found it was perfect."

"P_142",1,0,1,0,0,"Although stressful, proposal deadlines force us to put a timeline with a HARD immovable target date. This requires us to compile many of our ideas and hone them into a good story. As it has currently stood, much of the ""prior research"" for proposals has been completed within the ~1month before the deadline. Some of this is due to waiting for calls to identify topics, forming teams, etc., but also due to prioritization. We are so focused on meeting our existing deadlines for FUNDED programs that we cannot devote the time to exploring the NEW ideas/concepts until we have no other choice. This leads to a constantly high stress level. Although you can get things done, you never have enough time to get ahead, to think creatively, and truly explore limits.

The other stressful part is that people depend on you and your ability to secure funding to pay them (grad students, postdocs,...).  Every proposal is submitted with these people in mind, having proposal rejected despite having good reviews puts these people in jeopardy. As a person who cares about students, I find this also stressful."

I must turn in final budgets, including any subcontracts, to my university 1 month before a deadline, so that means that I can't respond to RFAs with short times to deadlines - and webinars held 1 month before a deadline are almost useless.  When an RFA is announced in the middle of a semester, my time for that semester might already be too committed to respond to an RFA - I need to know BEFORE the semester starts so that I MIGHT be able to postpone some other things like undergraduate research projects or grad student rotations or committee work to the next semester.

In some cases, there are arguments with our SRO about ambiguous elements of the requirements that need clarification from NSF, and last minute changes. It's also getting to the point that the project summary page has so many requirements that it is hard to include much about the actual proposal.

"P_324",0,0,1,1,0,"It's incredibly frustrating to spend so much time on something that has so little chance of success. The constant need to chase after the next grant to support myself or my students take significant time away from publishing additional articles on past grants, as well as strongly discouraging truly innovative research ideas. If an idea deviates substantially from the natural ""next step"" on a topic, I know it has exactly 0% chance of success. It also strongly discourages me from applying to other agencies, since I know I'm not part of the ""old boys"" club, which is alive and well. The increase in amount of administration and forms disproportionately advantages researchers from top tier universities (including mine), which provide substantial administrative support in submission and management of grants. If I was at a lower tier university, there is no chance that I could submit and manage as many grants as I do currently. This is a fantastically effective way to squash diversity, by raising the status bar for individuals who can submit grants. My last grant to support one student for three years was over 225 pages long - and funding rates hover around 15%. What a tremendous waste of intellectual resources to spend hours and hours compiling CVs, C&Ps, COAs, and all the other required forms. It also strongly benefits senior personnel who have administrative staff that can maintain these resources for them. Some forms are obviously necessary, but why not refer reviewers to ORCIDs and google scholar or web of science profiles? Also, each agency has their own forms, so they aren't transferable. I submit to NIJ, NSF, NASA, as well as philanthropic foundations. Rolling deadlines would be better, since proposals are more likely to be submitted when they're truly ready, instead of when they're due. "
